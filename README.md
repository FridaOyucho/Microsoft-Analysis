### Overview
This project analyzes the movie landscape curated by Microsoft for its emerging movie studio. A descriptive analysis of the popularity of movies, the average duration of movies, 
and movies with the highest revenue shows that comedy and drama are the most popular genres of Movies, the average duration of a movie is 90 minutes and the genre with the highest 
revenue is drama. The Microsoft company can use this analysis to inform their revenue and budget allocation during the creation of movies and invest most resources in the movies that 
will return the highest revenue.

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know 
anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into 
actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Data
The datasets for the different box offices provide most information needed about movies and the different genres i.e runtime, Production Budget, movie popularity, worldwide 
gross e.t.c  

### Methods
The project uses descriptive analysis including a density plot representing the distribution of the numeric variables i.e. distribution of worldwide profit. The charts provide 
an insightful overview of Microsoft to identify genres with resource needs

 ### Results
 The graph displays a right-skewed distribution, with most movies lasting 90-120 minutes. The mean runtime is around 108 minutes, with outliers on the right, possibly signifying 
 epics or documentaries with longer durations.

The density plot visually represents profit distribution, aiding trend identification and outlier detection. It offers valuable insights into the financial dynamics of the film 
industry, facilitating strategic decision-making.

   it's essential to carefully assess the cost-benefit relationship to ensure profitability.
4. Profitable Genres: Consider prioritizing the production of Drama, Horror, and History genres, as they contribute to the highest revenue.
